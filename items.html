                        Pizza is an Italian food that was created in Italy (The Naples area). It is made with different toppings. Some of the most common toppings
                        are cheese, sausages, pepperoni, vegetables, tomatoes, spices and herbs and basil. These toppings are added over a piece of bread covered 
                        with sauce. Pizza toppings are also packed with a compound called glutamate, which can be found in the tomatoes, cheese, pepperoni and 
                        sausage. When glutamate hits our tongues, it tells our brains to get excited - and to crave more of it. This compound actually causes our 
                        mouths to water in anticipation of the next bite.
